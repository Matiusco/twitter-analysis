EU immigrants contribute £2,300 more per person per year to UK coffers than does average UK citizen."
Barbara Jemec,"Many people voted Leave to reduce immigration, thinking that EU migrant workers were a drain on UK resources.

Well, how wrong they were.

Share this with anyone you know who voted Leave and ask them to reconsider. They deserve a #PeoplesVote."
